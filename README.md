# nn-jax
A simple neural net written in JAX trained on the MNIST dataset

This work was essentially a follow-along of [this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU) by [Samson Zhang](https://github.com/wwsalmon).
I chose to use JAX with the intent of using GPU acceleration as well as trying out it's built in automatic differentiation, but haven't yet implemented it
